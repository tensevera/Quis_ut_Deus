My term project - graphic RPG.

The game is based on the SDL2 platform and is coded in C/C++. Game itself doesn't leak memory, however used library does.
Game is played using WASD keys and enter.
All importent files are included in the assets folder.

Shout out to LuizMelo for the knight texture (https://luizmelo.itch.io/medieval-warrior-pack-3).
